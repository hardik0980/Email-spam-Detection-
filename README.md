1. Importing some important Libraries 
2. Load the Data
3. Checking a null values
4. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Perform statistics method
6. Creating chart necessary 
7. Data Preprocessing
8. Feature Extraction  #TfidfVectorizer incorporates several of these preprocessing steps automatically, while also noting any steps that might need to be handled separately.
9. Training and Testing the data
